# Color Scheme Generator

Generate desired color schemes

Select a color option from the color picker, a mode option from the dropdown options and then generate the results by clicking on the get color scheme button.

The hex code value for each color is displayed at the bottom of the page.

You can copy the hex value of the desired color to the clipboard by clicking on the value itself, this will set off an alert on the page to confirm value has been successfully copied
